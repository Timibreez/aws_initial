Deploy Static Website on AWS

In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS using S3, CloudFront, and IAM.

The files included are: 

index.html - The Index document for the website.
/img - The background image file for the website.
/vendor - Bootssrap CSS framework, Font, and JavaScript libraries needed for the website to function.
/css - CSS files for the website.

Public access urls

At the time of viewing this code, this links would have become inaccessible, so please do 
well to create a new bucket and follow the process to host a static site on aws. 
Thanks
Happy Coding
